# MailMergeProject
# Overview
Welcome to the Mail Merge Project! This project streamlines the process of sending personalized emails by generating individualized text files for each person.
The project takes a common template file, adds each person's name, and creates separate text files that can be directly sent as emails. It uses the file concept in Python.
